    # == Description
    # This provides an interface for the +category+ resource.
    # With a category instance, you can fetch its sub-resources such as #videos, #groups and #channels assigned to it.
    #
    # Note that categories are read only.
    # == Usage
    # This class is typically initialized by the client when fetching a category with its _name_ such as:
    #  client = Vimeo::Client.new access_token: '1234'
    #  category = client.category 'animation' #=> <Vimeo::Entities::Category>
    #  category.videos #=> <Vimeo::Collection>
    # You can also initialize your own instance with its _name_ if you are for example, quickly after
    # the categories sub-resources
    #  client = Vimeo::Client.new access_token: '1234'
    #  category = Vimeo::Entities::Category.new client, name: 'animation' #=> Vimeo::Entities::Category
    #  category.videos #=> <Vimeo::Collection>
    # == More information
